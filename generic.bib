	abstract = {It is common to encounter symmetric monoidal categories \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ for which every object is equipped with an algebraic structure, in a way that is compatible with the monoidal product and unit in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$. We define this formally and say that \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ supplies the algebraic structure. For example, the category \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Rel\}\$ of relations between sets has monoidal structures given by both cartesian product and disjoint union, and with respect to either one it supplies comonoids. We prove several facts about the notion of supply, e.g. that the associators, unitors, and braiding of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ are automatically homomorphisms for any supply, as are the coherence isomorphisms for any strong symmetric monoidal functor that preserve supplies. We also show that any supply of structure in a symmetric monoidal category can be extended to a supply of that structure on its strictification.},

This means that we treat the following concepts in purely abstract categorical terms: conditioning and disintegration; various versions of conditional independence and its standard properties; conditional products; almost surely; sufficient statistics; versions of theorems on sufficient statistics due to Fisher--Neyman, Basu, and Bahadur. Besides the conceptual clarity offered by our categorical setup, its main advantage is that it provides a uniform treatment of various types of probability theory, including discrete probability theory, measure-theoretic probability with general measurable spaces, Gaussian probability, stochastic processes of either of these kinds, and many others.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1609.03103},
	abstract = {This work contributes to a compositional theory of "co-design" that allows to optimally design a robotic platform. In this framework, the user describes each subsystem as a monotone relation between "functionality" provided and "resources" required. These models can be easily composed to express the co-design constraints among different subsystems. The user then queries the model, to obtain the design with minimal resources usage, subject to a lower bound on the provided functionality. This paper concerns the introduction of uncertainty in the framework. Uncertainty has two roles: first, it allows to deal with limited knowledge of the models; second, it also can be used to generate consistent relaxations of a problem, as the computation requirements can be lowered, should the user accept some uncertainty in the answer.},

They produce channels, as conditional probabilities, from a joint state, or from an already given channel (in opposite direction). These notions exist in the literature, in concrete situations, but are presented here in abstract graphical formulations. The resulting abstract descriptions are used for proving basic results in conditional probability theory. The existence of disintegration and Bayesian inversion is discussed for discrete probability, and also for measure-theoretic probability --- via standard Borel spaces and via likelihoods. Finally, the usefulness of disintegration and Bayesian inversion is illustrated in several examples.},

It has become clear that as the ramifications of the theory of categories increase, the structures that A (A B) will carry will be richer and more complex.

    abstract = {Markov categories are a recent categorical approach to the mathematical foundations of probability and statistics. Here, this approach is advanced by stating and proving equivalent conditions for second-order stochastic dominance, a widely used way of comparing probability distributions by their spread. Furthermore, we lay foundation for the theory of comparing statistical experiments within Markov categories by stating and proving the classical Blackwell-Sherman-Stein Theorem. Our version not only offers new insight into the proof, but its abstract nature also makes the result more general, automatically specializing to the standard Blackwell-Sherman-Stein Theorem in measure-theoretic probability as well as a Bayesian version that involves prior-dependent garbling. Along the way, we define and characterize representable Markov categories, within which one can talk about Markov kernels to or from spaces of distributions. We do so by exploring the relation between Markov categories and Kleisli categories of probability monads.},
